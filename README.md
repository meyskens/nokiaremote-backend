Backend service for for [NokiaRemote](https://github.com/meyskens/NokiaRemote)

The Go program is meant to run on a public available server which is set in the NokiaRemote code.
You can connect a client using `nokiaremote watch` which connects over a websocket to the server to receive the keyboard commands.

This is a proof of concept, the code is not fully ready stable and secure. Use at own risk.
